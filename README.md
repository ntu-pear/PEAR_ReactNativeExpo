## Setting up

#### Installation

1. node version >= 12.0

```bash
# to check for node version run the following command.
node -v
```

2. expo-cli

```bash
npm i -g expo-cli
# if you're on mac and you haven't configured npm. Run the following command.
sudo npm i -g expo-cli
```

3. Install `expo client` on your phone from AppStore(ios) or PlayStore(android). This is for us to see how the app looks like on our physical devices.\
   [Link to playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US)\
   [Link to appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)\
4. Visual Studio Code edittor (optional but recommended), because you get access to all the shortcuts :).
   [Link to vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\
   - Extensions to install in vscode:
     - React native tools (built by microsoft)
     - react-native/react/redux snippets for es6/es7
     - prettier - code formatter by Esben Petersen (for linting)
     - material icon theme by Phillipp Kief (better folder icons)
5. Install react-native debugger from this [Link](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger).
6. Install android studio form this [Link](https://developer.android.com/studio). (ignore this if you already have it)
7. Install xcode for ios [Link](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

#### How to run?

Note: If you're on windows, you will probably only be able to run the `android` simulator. However, if you're on mac, you should be able to run both `android` and `ios` simulators.\

1. cd to `./PEAR_REACTNATIVEEXPO` root folder.
2. Remove `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file. (Note: NOT `package.json`)
3. run `npm install`.
4. run `npm start`, and expo will begin running.
   - To run `android` simulator. Hit the `a` key.
   - To run `ios` simulator. Hit the `i` key.
   - To run `web`. Hit the `w` key.

Some issues faced during installation guide:

- Android panic borken avd system (android simulator issue). [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39645178/panic-broken-avd-system-path-check-your-android-sdk-root-value)

#### How to run on physical device?

1. Simply scan the `QR code` (displayed after running `npm start`) using the `expo client`.

## Testing

Jest is used as a testing library to test the logic and the appearance of the components.
Please refer to the jest documentation in the links above and the existing tests for examples on how to write tests for your components.

### Adding a test

0. If a `__test__` directory does not exist in the root directory of your component,
   create a `__test__` directory in the root directory of your component. (Tests do not necessarily need to be for a component, it can be for any file that you wish to test, e.g. files that contain utiliy logic such as
   fetching/storing/modifying data).

Creating a `__test__` directory in the root of the component to be tested

```
├── components
      ├── __test__
      |     └── YourComponent.test.js
      └── YourComponent.js

```

1. To write a new test for your component, add a new file (<YourTestName.test.js>) to the `__test__` directory in the root directory of the component to be tested. (refer to example above).

2. To run your tests, run `npm test`.

3. For test re-running when relevant files have been changed (optional feature, like hot-reload), run `npm test-watch`.

## Do we have an onboarding document?

## Proper Conventions

- You are very much encouraged to include comment(s) on every function that you've created. This will help your friends better understand your code.
  - Better still, try to write `self_documenting_code`. It'll definitely help your friends. Refer to this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eczachly_softwareengineering-activity-6944815639593177088-rK-O/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web).
- If your function is too long, split them up. Remember [Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
- You are also very much encouraged to create `custom_hooks` to abstract certain logic. It helps!
- Lastly, just enjoy the process of building this app with your friends!
